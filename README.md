# Style Transfer Website

A website that applies artistic styles to your photo. Based on the Artistic Style Transfer using Neural Networks. This project is an extension of [Style transfer app](https://github.com/puneet29/StyleTransferApp)

## Live at [bit.ly/stylizeapp](https://bit.ly/stylizeapp)

Hosted using AWS EC2, AWS S3, Gunicorn and Flask.

## Architecture

## Quick Start

### Running locally

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/puneet29/stylizeapp.git
    cd stylizeapp
    ```

2. Create new virtual environment
    - On windows:

        ```bash
        py -3 -m venv venv
        ```

    - On Linux:

        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        ```

3. Activate virtual environment
    - On windows:

        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - On Linux:

        ```bash
        . venv/bin/activate
        ```

4. Install all the dependencies

    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements
    ```

5. Change the secret key in ```__init__.py``` at [#19](https://github.com/puneet29/stylizeapp/blob/master/__init__.py#L19). Replace ```os.urandom(24)```
   with actual bytes value.

6. Run Web App

    ```bash
    gunicorn -w 4 -t 600 __init__:app
    ```

### Running on server

Follow the same procedure, except 6th step. While running webapp we want the process to be daemonized, so that it runs in the background. For that:

- Run Web App

    ```bash
    gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:80 -w 4 -t 600 __init__:app -D
    ```

We bind our application to all HTTP IPv4 addresses on the server using
0.0.0.0:80 and run 4 gunicorn processes that serve our application. The timeout
for each gunicorn worker is set to 600 seconds, to account for 10 min delay
during uploading process. -D option daemonizes the process.
